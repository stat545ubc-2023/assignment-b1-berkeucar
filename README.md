# STAT545B - Assignment B1

Berke Ucar - M.Sc. Bioinformatics

This repository contains the code and markdown files for assignment B1 of STAT545B, which is developed by Berke Ucar. This assignment required me to develop a function, a documentation and tests for that function in a Rmd file. I wrote a function that takes a dataset and a column from that dataset and extracts the intended pattern(s) from that column. Furthermore, it contains a documentation for that function with using [roxygen2](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/rd-formatting.html) tags. It also contains the test functions for the edge cases of that function.

This repository consist of 3 files:
1. This README.md file - Contains the explanation and greeting for the repository
2. assignment_b1.Rmd - R markdown file that contains all the codes 
3. assignment_b1.md - Markdown file that is the knitted version of R markdown file for github to showcase

In order to rerun/recompile all the files, one can download the repository, either by using Github Desktop or with ```git clone``` command. Then, using R studio, one should use the Knit button to knit the _assignment_b1.Rmd_ file into _assignment_b1.md_. One should be careful about this procedure since it would overwrite _assignment_b1.md_ and cause to lose the old data of _assignment_b1.md_ file.
